# 👾 PyGame Mini Games
A collection of mini games built with **PyGame** while learning **Python**,
focusing on **game development**.


## ⌨️ Introduction
Welcome to my **PyGame Mini Games** repository! :3

This repository contains a collection of my mini games developed in Python
using the PyGame library. These project were created as hands-on practice to
explore game development concepts, such as game loops, event handling, and
basic game mechanics. I started developing these projects as a fun way to
learn and practice programming.


## 🦾 Purpose
**These projects were made to:**
- Strengthen my understanding of Python through game development
- Learn how games work and understand game developoment concepts
- Build consistency in maintaining projects on GitHub
